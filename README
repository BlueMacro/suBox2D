sc-Box2D is a simple wrapper for the Box2D physics engine intended for use
with the Cinder framework (libcinder.org).
Wraps Box2D version 2.2.1

Includes:
Sandbox for easier world and body creation
Objects for managing the lifetime of physics bodies and joints
Scale for converting between world and screen space
SimpleControl for easily setting up basic mouse interaction
Debug Renderer following Box2D convention

Goals:
Ease Box2d world setup and entity creation
Simplify proper coordinate conversion
Simplify Box2d entity lifetime management
Minimize additional interfaces to learn beyond Box2d and standard C++11
